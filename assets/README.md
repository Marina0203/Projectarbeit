## General Briefing

### Environment
* Use npm or yarn for package management

### HTML
* HTML must be W3C valid https://validator.w3.org/

### CSS
* Try to minimize custom CSS and instead override the BS5 variables
* Create for each section in the DOM an own SCSS file if it contains custom CSS
* Create a custom CSS class for each section with this naming scheme:
.ce-%ELEMENT_NAME%

### JS
* Don't use jQuery
* Build sections like independent components. That means, every HTML section should have itâ€™s own JavaScript file from the building process, if it requires custom scripts. This makes it possible to include JS files only if needed.
* The main js file should only contain necessary functions for the base layout. That could be for example menu and footer functions which are necessary on each page.
* All Elements should be placeable multiple times on the same page. This means the JavaScript needs working selectors for that case.
* Avoid using IDs for Element Selections

### Fonts
* If we are using any Google Fonts - Please download them into the project https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts
